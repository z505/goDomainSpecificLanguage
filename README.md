# goDomainSpecificLanguage
domain specific language in Go (possible abuse)

Use a variadic function to embed a mini programming language inside go, called JOKE LANG or Joke Language

Just a small sample, not complete, and is a silly little language.

Warnings: 
* avoid tricks like the plague  
* DSL = drug specific language. 
* Lisp = troublesome
